Create static folder static -> styles 
                            -> images
                            -> js
In style -> main.css (write css)

Go to settings.py
    STATICFILES_DIRS = [
        BASE_DIR / 'static' #or os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')
    ]
Then simply load tag {% load static %} and write href="{% static 'styles/main.css' %}

Now, tell django where to upload image file generated by user , edit settings.py
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static/images'
Now to show those images we need to tell django where to look for them by MEDIA_URL, by default it is empty string
MEDIA_URL = '/images/'
and in urls.py add these lines
"""
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static 

urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root = settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

"""

Now how to let users upload images from html forms
1st=> go to forms.py and add the field
